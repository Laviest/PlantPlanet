#PlantPlanet

This is a website for a plant design company.

It shows my skills of using the JS library 'React'.
We can see its usage in the plans section in the home page and in the "Meet the team" section in the about page.

This is a front-end project, so the technical back-end tings aren't set up, but i plan on doing that in the future.
